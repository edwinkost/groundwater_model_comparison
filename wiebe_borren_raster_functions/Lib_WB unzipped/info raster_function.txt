Write an PCRaster file: arr.write(PCRfilename)
Read an IDF: arr=raster2arr(yourIDF)
raster2arr(yourIDF).write(PCRfilename)



__________________________________________________________

The 'write' method recognizes the extension of the filename. 
For PCRaster files the extension should be .map.
If you want to use another extension instead of .map you should specify this in the write statement:


arr.write("test.pcr",raster_format="PCRaster")
